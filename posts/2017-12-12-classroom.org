  * Paperless classes conducted using G suite (drive, forms, docs,  etc).

  Similar reports regarding internals.

* Conclusions

  I have documented the work flow of each of the activities. And it is
  applicable to all departments. In fact the registration form, 
  subject allotment form and feedback forms are used by all the
  departments.

  I have experimented attendance form, generated automatically, from
  the students list for the course "Computer Networks". That will
  work for core, electives and labs where student groups need to be
  distinguished.

  A prototype of google classroom was created to run the "Computer
  Networks" course and my experience was good. Where, the teacher can
  assign questions, quizzes and assignments and track the progress of
  the students on line.

* Action Items

  In case the management is not working on any LMS,

  1) I will train the staff of all departments for adopting google
     classroom.

  2) Management takes a decision to create email accounts for
     students under www.atria.edu domain.
